## 🧩 Overview

CrowdTank is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built using **Solidity** and **Hardhat**.  
It allows users to:

- Withdraw funds based on conditions
- Admin to earn 5% commission per project

## 🔐 Smart Contract Features

- ✅ **Fund Projects**: With automatic 5% commission deduction
- ✅ **Refunds**: Users can withdraw funds if project fails
- ✅ **Creator Withdrawals**: After deadline if fully funded
- ✅ **Admin Withdrawals**: For accumulated commissions

- If contribution > funding goal, excess amount + commission is refunded
- Commission is stored per project and withdrawable by the system admin
